<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> name's bakshi, asad bakshi. I love football and coding 
and everything in between. I kind of have an easy-going personality
and absolutely no temperament. I love python and html and css and javascript
and when i finally make a code run the way its supposed to, what i feel is pure 
ecstacy.
</p>
<p> I might go to kcl in september, that is if i dont die, and the rest
is craaazy. I am both excited and nervous but i believe itll turn out good.
If i get a good result in class xii boards, ill probably be overwhelmed since
the physics paper was pure hell.
